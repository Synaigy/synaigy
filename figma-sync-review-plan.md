# Figma Sync Implementation Review Plan

## Overview

This document outlines a systematic approach to review the current Figma-sync implementation against our mapping plan. The goal is to identify gaps, issues, or areas for improvement to ensure the implementation correctly translates Figma variables to Tailwind configuration.

## Critical Requirements

1. **Collection References by Name**: Ensure collections are referenced by name (e.g., "1. Color modes") rather than by Figma's internal IDs.

2. **Multi-Skin Support**: Verify that the implementation supports multiple themes/skins (not just light/dark mode) based on Figma color modes.

3. **CSS Variable Structure**: Check that primitive colors are properly extracted and CSS variables are correctly structured.

## Review Checklist

### 1. Configuration & Setup

- [ ] Check how the Figma API connection is established
- [ ] Verify authentication method and token security
- [ ] Confirm the implementation is targeting the correct Figma file/project

### 2. Collection Parsing

- [ ] Verify collections are identified by name, not by IDs
- [ ] Check that all relevant collections are being processed (Color modes, Radius, Typography, etc.)
- [ ] Ensure the implementation is resilient to collection name changes or reordering

### 3. Color System Implementation

- [ ] Check extraction of primitive colors from `_Primitives` collection
- [ ] Verify RGB to HEX conversion accuracy
- [ ] Confirm CSS variables are created with appropriate naming convention
- [ ] Validate that color aliases correctly reference primitive colors
- [ ] Ensure all color modes/themes are properly implemented (not just light/dark)

### 4. Typography Implementation

- [ ] Verify font-family extraction and mapping
- [ ] Check font-weight extraction and mapping
- [ ] Confirm font-size extraction and conversion to rem
- [ ] Validate line-height extraction and mapping
- [ ] Ensure proper handling of both default and "Leading tight" variants

### 5. Border Radius Implementation

- [ ] Check extraction of radius values
- [ ] Verify mapping to Tailwind's borderRadius theme

### 6. Container Implementation

- [ ] Verify extraction of container padding values
- [ ] Confirm mapping to Tailwind's container theme

### 7. Output Generation

- [ ] Check the structure of generated CSS variables
- [ ] Verify Tailwind configuration output format
- [ ] Ensure proper organization and comments in output files
- [ ] Validate that output respects the Figma structure (paths like "Colors/Text/text-primary")

### 8. Theme Switching Mechanism

- [ ] Check how theme/skin switching is implemented
- [ ] Verify CSS classes are correctly generated for each theme
- [ ] Ensure the theme switching is efficient and doesn't cause flickering

## Implementation Improvements

### High Priority Fixes

1. **Collection Referencing**: If the implementation is using Figma IDs, modify to use collection names instead.

2. **Multiple Themes Support**: If only supporting light/dark mode, extend to support all color modes from Figma.

3. **CSS Variable Organization**: Ensure CSS variables reflect the Figma structure and are properly organized.

### Medium Priority Improvements

1. **Error Handling**: Add robust error handling for API failures, malformed data, etc.

2. **Logging**: Implement detailed logging for debugging and tracking synchronization issues.

3. **Performance Optimization**: Review for performance bottlenecks, especially when handling large Figma files.

### Nice-to-Have Enhancements

1. **Documentation Generation**: Auto-generate documentation showing Figma to Tailwind mapping.

2. **Visual Diff Tool**: Implement a tool to visualize differences between Figma values and current implementation.

3. **Caching Mechanism**: Add caching to reduce API calls and improve performance.

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**: Verify individual functions for parsing Figma data correctly.

2. **Integration Tests**: Confirm the end-to-end process works with real Figma data.

3. **Visual Regression Tests**: Compare rendered components across different themes to catch visual issues.

## Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1: Critical Fixes (1-2 days)

- Fix collection referencing
- Implement multi-skin support
- Correct CSS variable organization

### Phase 2: Structural Improvements (2-3 days)

- Enhance error handling
- Improve logging
- Optimize performance

### Phase 3: Validation and Documentation (1-2 days)

- Comprehensive testing
- Documentation updates
- Final review

## Next Steps

1. Review the current implementation code against this checklist
2. Document all gaps and issues found
3. Prioritize fixes based on the timeline above
4. Implement critical fixes first
5. Create tests to validate changes
6. Document the updated implementation
